# TenantSphere Project Setup and Architecture Guide

## Introduction
This document provides a structured approach to setting up and maintaining the TenantSphere project using NestJS with MongoDB. By following a clean and modular architecture, the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and easy for team members to understand and contribute to.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into a clear and concise structure to promote maintainability and scalability. The main directories are as follows:

```
src/
│
├── common/
│   ├── decorators/
│   ├── filters/
│   ├── interceptors/
│   ├── pipes/
│   ├── services/
│   └── interfaces/
│
├── config/
│   ├── app.config.ts
│   ├── database.config.ts
│   └── env.config.ts
│
├── modules/
│   ├── property/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── schemas/
│   │   ├── dto/
│   │   └── use-cases/
│   │
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── schemas/
│   │   ├── dto/
│   │   └── use-cases/
│   │
│   └── <other-modules>/
│
├── app.module.ts
└── main.ts
```

**Directory Breakdown:**

1. **common/**: Shared components like decorators, filters, interceptors, pipes, services, and interfaces used across modules.
2. **config/**: Configuration files for environment setup, database connections, and other settings.
3. **modules/**: Contains each feature module like property and user, further divided into controllers, services, repositories, schemas, dto, and use-cases.
4. **app.module.ts**: Root module of the application, importing and configuring feature modules and global providers.
5. **main.ts**: Entry point of the application. Initializes and starts the NestJS application.

## Setting Up the Environment
To ensure that anyone cloning the repository can quickly set up their environment and start working, follow these instructions:

**Step-by-Step Setup Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenant-sphere5/TenantSphere-server.git
   cd tenantsphere
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
   - Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) into `.env`.
   - Configure the environment variables such as database URLs, API keys, etc.
   **Example `.env` file:**

   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tenantsphere
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Run the Database Migrations (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   npm run migrations
   ```

5. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

6. **Testing:**
   - To run the unit tests:
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```
   - To run the e2e tests:
     ```bash
     npm run test:e2e
     ```
